## [1. Delayed Luggage Distribution Optimization](https://github.com/MuafiraThasni/Operations-Research/tree/main/Delayed%20Luggage)

In this project, the problem of distribution of delayed luggage is formulated as an optimization problem. The objective is to minimize the number of vehicles required for distributing the delayed luggages along with minimizing the total time. The formulated optimization problem is solved using gurobi API in python.

## [2. Supply Chain Optimization](https://github.com/MuafiraThasni/Operations-Research/tree/main/Supply-chain-optimization)

A linear programming model is developed to decide what raw material to order from which supplier and how to deliver the products to customers so that total cost is optimized.
In this work, ORTools is used for optimization.
